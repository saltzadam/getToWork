# getToWork
Commute calendar on Boston MBTA

Want to know how long your Boston public transit commute will be? You can use Google Maps (et al.), but it only shows you a range of possible times. getToWork will tell you how long that commute took on a particular day. It uses the MBTA's realtime tracking data.

Unfortunately that data is not yet fully available for bus routes, so this sadly only works for subway routes. I hope to build it out once the MBTA adds full bus data.
